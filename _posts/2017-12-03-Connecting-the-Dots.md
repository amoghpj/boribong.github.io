The most interesting part of Palmer's piece to me was his section advocating for care of students' emotions and emotional intelligence. As a scientist, and particularly as a female, we are told to ignore our emotions and do our work. Any showcase of emotions is seen as weak. We are told that science has no room for emotions. This mindset is particularly prevalent in graduate school, where we're told to just push through without feeling anything. When a graduate student talks about not sleeping, not eating, being stressed beyond belief, etc. we're all told this is a normal part of the process. We're not given advice on how to cope, we're not given advice to make our situation better, we're simply told that everyone also feels this way and to be strong is to simply push through. We aren't encourage to be open and honest about our struggles. We aren't asked to take a look at the institution that pressures its students to work beyond their capacity.
