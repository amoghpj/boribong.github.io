I have not taught. I have not taught a class and I have not been taught how to teach. I am fortunate enough that as a graduate student, I have been funded through GRA positions through several different programs. However, I do want to go into academia and the longer I put off teaching, the more daunting it feels. I'm afraid of being out of touch and not remembering what it is like as a student leanring a subject. I'm afraid of teaching just to pay the bills and not out of passion, as I was taught. How do I develop a teaching voice? I can't develop one through trial and error, there are students' education on the line. I can't learn through theory. How do I have a teaching voice without having experience teaching?
