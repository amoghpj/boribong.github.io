Hello, my name is Brittany Boribong. I received my B.S. from the [University of Scranton](http://www.scranton.edu/) in [Biomathematics](http://admissions.scranton.edu/academic-programs/majors-minors/programs/biomathematics.shtml) in 2015. I am currently a second-year graduate student in the [Genetics, Bioinformatics, and Computational Biology (GBCB)](http://gbcb.vbi.vt.edu/) program and a pre-doctoral scholar in the [Initiative for Maximizing Student Development (IMSD)](http://imsd.apsc.vt.edu/) program at [Virginia Tech](http://www.vt.edu/). My research interests lie in mathematical modeling of dynamic biological processes, particularly within innate immunity. I currently work under Dr. [Liwu Li](http://www.faculty.biol.vt.edu/li/) and Dr. [Caroline Jones](http://vtjoneslab.com/) from the Department of Biological Sciences. My research involves quantifying neutrophil migration during sepsis using microfluidic devices and deterministic ODE modeling.

Please feel free to contact me at boribong at vt.edu or connect with me on [social media](https://boribong.github.io/media/).
