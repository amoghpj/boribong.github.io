Hello, my name is Brittany Boribong. I received my B.S. from the [University of Scranton](http://www.scranton.edu/) in [Biomathematics](http://admissions.scranton.edu/academic-programs/majors-minors/programs/biomathematics.shtml) in 2015. I am currently a second-year graduate student in the [Genetics, Bioinformatics, and Computational Biology (GBCB)](http://gbcb.vbi.vt.edu/) program and a pre-doctoral scholar in the [Initiative for Maximizing Student Development (IMSD)](http://imsd.apsc.vt.edu/) program at [Virginia Tech](http://www.vt.edu/).

Please feel free to contact me at boribong at vt.edu or connect with me on [social media](https://boribong.github.io/media/).
