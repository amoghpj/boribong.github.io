As an undergraduate, I worked with the National Relief Network in Braithwaite, LA to assist in Hurricane Isaac relief in taking down condemned homes. I have traveled to Breezy and Rockaway, NY to assist in Hurricane Sandy relief. Our efforts included cleaning up a [local marsh](http://marshmakers.blogspot.com/2014/03/university-of-scranton-students-help-out_17.html) and beach, cleaning an abandoned storehouse for an [art installation](https://www.instagram.com/p/rIBkUjBQRZ/?taken-at=314291161), and working with the Friends of Rockaway to rebuild a home for a local family deplaced by Hurricane Sandy. I worked with the Francis Corp volunteers in Syracuse, NY at the Catholic Youth Organization to assist in the refugee resettlement process, including helping with job interviews, shadowing a case worker, and as a helper for school programs. I also volunteered at the Assumption Church Soup Kitchen and Food Pantry, Francis House, and the Vincent House as a mentor during school programs. 

In addition to volunteer work, I am also interested in outreach programs. As an undergraduate, I participated in several science outreach programs aimed both at children and fellow students. As math club president at the University of Scranton, I ran several programs on how to become active in research in mathematics. I also tutored students in the Scranton Bhutanese community in math and biology. These kids had grown up in refugee camps in Nepal and received refugee status in the U.S. and resettled in the Scranton area.

As a graduate student, I've continued volunteering for several science outreach programs, including Kids' Tech University and the STEM summer workshop. In August 2016, I attended the Mathematical Biosciences Institute Undergraduate Capstone Conference in Columbus, OH as a representative for the Genetics, Bioinformatics, and Computational Biology program at Virginia Tech to encourage students to pursue interdisciplinary research. I also have the opportunity to mentor other students in science through the Intiative for Maximizing Student Development program and mentoring undergraduates in my research lab.
